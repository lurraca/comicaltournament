Purpose
================

**You:** Why would someone in full posession of his/her mental faculties would waste his/her time on something like this?

*Mostly educational purposes, I been dying to try the MEAN stack for a while so I took my limited brain for spin and this is what I came up with. I know, I know, is not the most brilliant or exciting idea idea but this is what I actually needed a simple project that could done in short time so I don't drift away and start looking for the next thing without even finishing this up.*

**You:** Why you went all sentimental on me? JEEZ!

Contributing
================

**You:** OMG! this site is so **ugly!!!**

*I'm not a designer. If you feel that you can get work your mojo and rainbows to improve this site looks and feel, please be my guest.*

**You:** This code sucks. Who coded this? [Amy?!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXlSFKLuzTA) :monkey:

*I am by no means an expert JS developer. In fact this is my first real JS project (if you can it that), let alone node.js or angularjs. So if you feel you can upgrade the monkey code or improve the project structure feel free to send your PR.*

**You:** OH BOY! You call these test?

*See previous answer. I'm not very familiar with best TDD practices in the JS community (I did some research though). So again, if you feel you can improve the test suite or point some library or framework that would improve the testing of this project feel free to do so*
